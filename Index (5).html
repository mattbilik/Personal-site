<p style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgreen"><sup>ABOUT ME</sup><br>As you know, I like to code. Its one of my favorite hobbies. Its the creativity that gets me. The fact that you can make anything your heart desires. Yeah its that feeling that makes me go on. And yes im not just putting in random "Lorem Ipsum" im taking the time to write you, and this webpage a paragraph. A paragraph about me and just me. And no Im not selfish its just that this is my portfolio, not yours. I like to read too. Movies are too mundane and pedestrian for my liking. Its almost like they are stagnant in their place. Wait no. That dosent make sense.<sub>Stop using big words you doofus!</sub>Anyways I also enjoy to write. Isn't it strange that someone who is not the littlest bit mathematical has made a website? Nah. I personally do not believe that being good with math has any direct correlation with coding. Its the effort that counts. And for all you people who think coding is only for people who are smart, you are wrong. Anyone can code. How do you think Mark Zuckerberg learned to do it? Like me, from the internet of course! Oh yeah, did I say I like videogames? Well I do I guess they are kind of my life. Its usually all I do<sub>Other from reading and coding.</sub>Videogames are very useful materials to learn. From playing Minecraft when I was 8, I learned how to socialize, make friends and best of all, learn what the word sapling meant. Hah, those days... 10/18/15</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgreen"><sup>WORK</sup><br> I've done lots of work with coding over the last year or so. I know Java and Html and for the Science Fair my team built an arduino controlled robot. <a href="loading1.html" style="Color:red">Click here for more.</a> I have also been experimenting with bitcoin (Even though it is impossible to make any money from it if you dont have 50 million processors and hard drives) For now, I have a super simple setup. I have 3 ASIC USB Bitcoin mining chips connected to a 4 port USB power strip. Oh i almost forgot the cooling!(AKA the most important thing in the setup...) I stuck a USB fan onto it for good measure.*wink *wink. I have made a bunch of calculators in java and have yet to learn Java Script. Wow this makes me want some java really, really badly. We need more wity geniuses on this planet. My ego is too high sometimes, but im not egotistical about it. Speaking of java and code I also have experience with blender and unity. I have a model of a policeman and a cowboy somewhere stored in my computer from blender and will post it if I find the information. Okay im gonna take a break from writing, I have spanish homework to do. 10/26/15
