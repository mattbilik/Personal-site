        <p style="color:lightgreen"><sup>SCHOOL</sup> School is one of my favorite places to be. You learn so many new things everyday. I go to a prestigious school called "The Scholars Academy" We are very centered around technology and everything we do revolves around it. In my school instead of textbooks and notepads we use google docs and many other very useful google softwares. We use these to get rid of the mundane and boring old way of teaching and to introduce students to technology at a young age. As a seventh grader I would love to attend Brooklyn Tech or Stuyvesant but, I am weary because of how hard they are to get in. Maybe someday I will be able to join Stuy Pulse but no for now. In NYC we are a very competitive bunch trying to get into the best of the best. For right now I am not very proud of my grades. With a puny 4.0 average and in percentage a 94% average I need to do better. My friends are beating me by almost 4%. Anyways I am a good student and get grades higher than 95% of my school. As you may know I have a wonderful teacher named Mr Pigis who instructs my html class with a selected few. He has taught me so much and I am forever grateful to him. School is my outlet for creation and ideas. I gather everything I know and turn it into something that is useful. From my chemical reactor in my achievements page to my mechanical arm and robot. School is really a great place and dosent have to be boring. Its your outlook that makes it boring. There are many different ideologies out there for school and how it should run but I am sure it is alright the way it is, even though it dosent prepare you for a lot of things you might be faced with. Alright enough of my blabbering. </p>
